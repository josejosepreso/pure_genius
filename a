Parannoul - Beautiful World (English Translation) Lyrics
(What are you listening to?)
(Lily Chou-Chou)
If this whole world were someone else's dream
Will I be different from now when I wake up someday
Trapped in my own delusion, unable to see reality properly
I walk around looking pathetic, cover my eyes and ears again
"It’s gonna be okay someday. You're gonna shine someday."
I'm so disgusted with myself getting farther away from the world
I’m afraid of the future, I make the same mistakes again and again
"It's gonna bе okay someday. You're gonna shine somеday."
(I need you to protect me)
I wish no one had seen my miserable self
I wish no one had seen my numerous failures
I wish my young and stupid days to disappear forever
My precious relationships, now they're just in the memories
